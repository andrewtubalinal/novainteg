# NovaInteg - The Sound Scheme for Nova AI

Welcome to **NovaInteg**, the **sound scheme** designed to complement the **Nova AI** voice model, powered by **TTSMP3 AI** ([TTSMP3 AI](https://ttsmp3.com/ai)). This repository provides a set of **custom sound effects** that enhance the **Nova AI** experience by adding clear, engaging feedback for various system actions, making interactions more intuitive and fun.

**Nova** is the voice model from TTSMP3 AI, and this scheme is designed to give your system a **futuristic, interactive sound experience** to accompany your Nova AI-powered interactions.

## What’s Included
- **Custom Sound Scheme**: Includes sounds for various system events like **"Start Navigation"**, **"Misrecognition"**, **"Sleep"**, and more.
